description: This is an application made using <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" target="_blank">wxWidgets</a> and Daniel Isdell's <a href="http://clanbadge.com/" target="_blank">Celtic Knot Font</a>, to randomly generate Celtic knots. It is still in its early stage with more features being added, like different types of symmetry or wrapping around the borders. Portions of the knot can be edited, so you can make it exactly how you want!
