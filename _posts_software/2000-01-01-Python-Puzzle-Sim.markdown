description: I made a puzzle simulator with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/" target="_blank">Pygame library</a> in 2017/2018, complete with from-scratch 3D graphics, turning animations, and custom puzzles. It is very simple to use, but specifying a new puzzle file is a pain. I am slowly working on a new simulator in C++ with more lenient rules on which puzzles can be simulated.
