description: After my puzzle simulator in Pygame, I started working on my new puzzle simulator in C++. I wanted to mathematically represent a sticker's non-polygonal edge as its true intended shape instead of storing it as a long list of very small straight lines. I wrote this paper to document the math on how to parametrize these curves uniformly.<br><br>This is the first step in making my vision of this simulator into a reality!
