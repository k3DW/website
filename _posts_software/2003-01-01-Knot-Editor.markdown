description: <b>bask3twork</b> is an application made using <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" target="_blank">wxWidgets</a> and Daniel Isdell's <a href="http://clanbadge.com/" target="_blank">Celtic Knot Font</a>, to randomly generate Celtic knots. It is still in its early stage with more features being added soon. Portions of the knot can be edited and locked for editing, so you can make it exactly how you want!
