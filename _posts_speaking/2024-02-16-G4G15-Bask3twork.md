title: "\"Bask3twork\": Procedurally Generating Symmetric Celtic Knots"

youtube-link: https://youtu.be/vDFzz2ex7_s

description: "\"Bask3twork\" is a program that procedurally generates Celtic knots in a square grid using any subset of D4 symmetry, that of a square, including no symmetry at all. The secret? A font! The font's glyphs can be mixed, matched, and assembled to your heart's content. However, instead of creating Celtic knots manually, we can sit back and watch Bask3twork generate infinite possibilities."
