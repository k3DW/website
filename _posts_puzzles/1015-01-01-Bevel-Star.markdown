description: The Bevel Star is an edges-only <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=2300" target="_blank">Helicopter Cube</a>, inspired by the shape of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_dodecahedron#Stellations" target="_blank">second stellation of the rhombic dodecahedron</a> and the puzzle <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=639" target="_blank">Alexander's Star</a>. I made this puzzle before knowing it had already been created by another creator, hence "remake". This puzzle is featured in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_puzzle_advent_calendar/" target="_blank">Puzzle Advent Calendar</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtysvchxBCmTZ-lz3-87ylGtATBW5pHbH" target="_blank">2024</a>.
