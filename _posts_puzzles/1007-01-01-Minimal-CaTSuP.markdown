description: The <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=6958" target="_blank">Minimal CaTSuP</a> is inspired by <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2515" target="_blank">Oskar's "Minimal" series</a> of puzzles, but this time done to the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=6056" target="_blank">CaTSuP</a>. Like the <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=6056" target="_blank">CaTSuP</a>, this puzzle has few pieces but is deceptively difficult to solve!
